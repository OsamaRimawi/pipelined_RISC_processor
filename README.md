# pipelined_RISC_processor
The aim of our project is to design and test a simple single cycle RISC processor, and to build a data path ISA which has three instructions formats namely, R-type, I-type and J-type with 24-bits using the Logisim simulator tool.

### In this repository You can Find the Processor Design Files using the Logisim simulator tool.
